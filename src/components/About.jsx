                    <p>Hi Pals, Namaste üôè.</p>
                    <p>I'm a Pre-Final Year Undergraduate student at VIT Pune, on a journey to pursue a Bachelor of Technology in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My passion lies in Competitive Programming, mastering Data Structures and Algorithms, and crafting engaging web experiences.</p>
                    <p>I like to explore different technologies and practice brainstorming coding problems on different coding platforms such as Codechef, Codeforces, Leetcode, and GFG. I am also a Full Stack Developer and have done some projects on that.</p>
                    <p>I'm fluent in Java, JavaScript, React, Python, C++, and MySQL, both with my fingers and my passion for coding. When it comes to communication, I'm comfortable in English, Hindi, and Marathi.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of tech, I indulge in some downtime. I'm a huge fan of "Haikyu!!" (and you should be too if you haven't watched it yet). On weekends, I fire up my mobile for some BGMI action. And, when I'm craving some outdoor fun, I enjoy playing Cricket, Badminton, and Chess.</p>
                    <p>Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities that the world of technology has to offer. Together, we can create, innovate, and inspire. üöÄüåü</p>
